# CHURN PREDICTION SYSTEM 
Customer Churn Prediction Dashboard – FutureInterns Internship (Task 2)
This project was completed as part of Task 2 in my internship with FutureInterns, where I built a churn prediction model using machine learning and visualized the insights using Power BI.

# 📌 Project Objective
To analyze telecom customer data and predict the likelihood of customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave or stay). The project uses a classification model and builds a Power BI dashboard to help businesses identify at-risk customers and reduce churn.

# 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI Desktop

Logistic Regression & Random Forest

Visualization (Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Filters, Slicers)

# 🧠 What I Did
Preprocessed and cleaned the customer churn dataset

Trained a machine learning model to predict churn probabilities

Exported model predictions to .csv

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard including:

Churn breakdown by gender, tenure, internet service, and payment method

Churn probability vs total charges

Risk level slicer (High, Moderate, Low)

KPI Cards for total charges, customer count, tenure, and senior citizens

# 📈 Key Business Insights
Customers with short tenure and higher total charges are more likely to churn.

Electronic check users show the highest churn.

Fiber optic users tend to churn more than DSL users.

Gender has almost no effect on churn.
